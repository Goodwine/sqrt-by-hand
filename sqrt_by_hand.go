// sqrtLittleSquares is the initial algorithm to get square root by hand, this is the closest

// diving deeper into the recursive nature that repeats for infinity.
// Input is an integer because we humans know really well how to use integers and we struggle
// a little when trying to do floating point number operations.
// I called it "little squares" because the algorithm goes recursively trying to get a value
// for the little square in the corner.
